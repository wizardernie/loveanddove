--Readme--

love (he/him) and dove (he/him) are two buff best friends with the same interest in feminine fashion. they like to spend a lot of time at the apple blossom leisure centre, where they can work out, socialise, try new things and meet new people (such as you!). most of the conversations will be them talking to each other about everyday things in their lives.

you can see a little bit more info on love and dove on my site, as well as the other work i've done and other places to find me. i make games and other random things from time to time. this is my first attempt at making a ghost. if you like you can send me a message or tag me if you post anything related to love and dove!

lucid (shell artist)

the artist of the shell who chose to remain (mostly) anonymous so i don't have any links for you sorry! but lets all take the time to appreciate the amazing work you can see in this ghost :)

the guide and templates from http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/ made this possible.

idk if i should be using a proper license but for copyright you basically can share just don't change any code. the base shell is not a freeshell!
