# Love and Dove
These are the files for the ukagaka, or ghost, Love and Dove! If you don't know what that is or how to download it, please use [this site](https://ukagakadreamteam.com/wiki/guide/beginner_guide) for more information. So far, they are a pretty simplistic ukagaka (the balloon is jank, I will fix), I plan on updating it more in the future.

My own [website](https://wizardernie.nekoweb.org/projects.html) contains some more information on these two characters.

This was created with the base from [this tutorial](https://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/). It would not have been possible without it!
